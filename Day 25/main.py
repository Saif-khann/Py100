Day 25 Project: U.S. States Game
-----------------------------------
Description:
This script creates an interactive game using the Turtle graphics library and the Pandas library
to help users learn the names of all 50 U.S. states. When the game starts, an empty U.S. map is displayed,
and the user is prompted to input state names one by one. Correct guesses are displayed on the map.
The game continues until all 50 states are guessed or the user exits. The states not guessed are saved
to a CSV file for further learning.

Note: Make sure to have the 'pandas' library installed to run this script.
You can install it using: pip install pandas
