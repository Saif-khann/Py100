# Create a fun text-based adventure game where the user navigates through obstacles to find a hidden treasure.

# Description:
# 1. Greet the user and introduce the adventure game.
# 2. Use ASCII art to display a title for the game.
# 3. Present the user with multiple choices as they navigate through a series of obstacles (e.g., crossing roads, lakes, and choosing doors).
# 4. Depending on their decisions, they either win the game by finding the treasure or face different outcomes (game over scenarios).
# 5. Ensure the input choices are case-insensitive for better user experience.

# Code starts here...
