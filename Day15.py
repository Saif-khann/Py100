Day 15: Coffee Machine
-----------------------------------
This program simulates a coffee machine that can make espresso,
latte, and cappuccino. Users can insert coins to buy coffee, 
and the machine will check resources, process transactions, 
and make the coffee if resources are sufficient and payment 
is successful.
