# Day 12: Number Guessing Game
# This program is a number guessing game where the player tries 
# to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. The player 
# selects a difficulty level, which determines the number of guesses 
# allowed. After each guess, the program gives hints and tracks 
# the remaining attempts until the player wins or runs out of attempts.
