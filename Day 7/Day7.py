Day 7: Hangman Project
-----------------------------------
This project is a game of Hangman where a random word is chosen, and the player has to guess the letters in the word. 
The player starts with 6 lives.
Each incorrect guess reduces the player's lives, and the game ends when the player either guesses all the letters (win) or loses all lives (lose).
The program uses predefined hangman art and word lists from external files `hangman_art.py` and `hangman_words.py`.
