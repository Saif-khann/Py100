Day 14: Higher Lower Game
-----------------------------------
This program is a 'Higher Lower' game where the player tries 
to guess which of two Instagram accounts has more followers.
The player continues guessing and earning points until they 
make a wrong guess. The game utilizes random account data 
and provides continuous feedback and score tracking.
