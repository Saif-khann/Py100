Day 21 - Snake Game Part 2
-----------------------------------
This project is an extension of the classic Snake Game. The snake can now eat food to grow and
earn points, and the game keeps track of the score. The game ends if the snake collides with
the wall or its own tail. The screen and game logic have been enhanced to provide a better
gaming experience.
