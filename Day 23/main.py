Day 23: Turtle Crossing Game
-----------------------------------
Description:
This project simulates a classic Turtle Crossing game. 
The player, represented by a turtle, attempts to cross a road while avoiding moving cars. 
As the player progresses, the game speeds up and becomes more challenging.

Files:
- main.py: Main game loop, initializing objects, and handling screen updates.
- player.py: Handles the player turtle's movement and position.
- car_manager.py: Manages car creation, movement, and speed adjustments.
- scoreboard.py: Manages and displays the player's current level and game over message.
